# TSI-Schedule-Scraping-Backend-v2
TSI Schedule Scraper is a tool to copy TSI lectures schedule to your Google Calendar. It collects lecture schedules from the TSI website and transfers them to Google Calendar. This automation saves students the time and effort of manually entering each lecture into their calendar. The application uses web scraping techniques to gather data from the TSI website since direct access to the lecture schedule database or API is unavailable.
